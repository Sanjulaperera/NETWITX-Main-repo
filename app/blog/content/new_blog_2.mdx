# Which One is Right for You?

Choosing between a custom and a template website can be challenging. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide.

## Template Websites
    Affordable, quick to set up, and great for small businesses.
   Limited customization and generic designs.
  
   - **Ease of use:** Templates require minimal technical skills and are beginner-friendly.
   - **Cost considerations:** Ideal for startups with limited budgets.

<br />

## Custom Websites
     Fully tailored to a brand, scalable, and offers unique functionalities. 
    Requires a higher budget but provides long-term benefits. 
   
   - **Advanced features:** Integrate custom tools and APIs to enhance functionality.
   - **Scalability:** Easily adapt to future business needs and growth.
